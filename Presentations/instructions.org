#+title: How to use Org Mode for Presentations
#+author: hgp

* Setup & Packages

First, run =M-x package-install RET org-tree-mode=

Then, add to your config file
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(require 'org-tree-mode)
#+end_src

You can find the detailed explanation of how this package works here:

* Presentation

Open your .org file and run: =M-x org-tree-mode=

This will take elements from your file and put the title, author and date
on top of the screen.

To navigate through slides use =C-<=  and =C->=.

I find usefull the =org-tree-slide-play-with-timer= to have a countdown,
in order to keep track of the time.

* Costumization

In order to costumize the looks of the presentation,
you need to create a profile using =M-x org-tree-slide-profile=
